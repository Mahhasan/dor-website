                    The Division of Research of DIU started its journey in July 2017. The goal of the research endeavor of Division of Research is to build a research culture at the department level and the university as a whole and consequently, establish DIU as a Research University in international arena. Managing and conducting collaborative research with national and foreign universities is an important part of our endeavors. Participation in world university rankings (especially THE and QS) and ensure a position in the ranking list in the future is the best way to be recognized DIU by the global community. Quality education and research are two most important ingredients of world university rankings. <br>
                    For achievement of the goals, we give priority on setting up a research infrastructure in the university, and creating an appropriate environment for research and publications through awareness and capacity building, motivation, inspiration and encouragement of the faculty. These initiatives reveal positive impacts in terms of increasing number of Scopus publications of our faculty. <br>
                    This site will be resourceful gradually in course of time. <br><br>
